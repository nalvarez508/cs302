in solving these exercises it is the intention that containers
algorithms function objects iterators and other standard
components are to be used as much as possible if applicable and
even when it is not explicitly stated use containers for storing data
note that associative containers store the elements in sorted order
which one can take advantage of in solving certain problems use
algorithms rather than loops if possible use function objects
predefined or create your own in combination with algorithms rather
than using simple functions
